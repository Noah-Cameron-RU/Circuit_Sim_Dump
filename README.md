# Circuit_Sim_Dump
The purpose of this assignment is to perform some boolean algebra in a circuit simulation.  Bascially, there will be a set of inputs, either 0's, 1's, or a mix of the two, and we will run those inputs through the circuit and see if it spits out true or false

Types of switches:
-AND gate
-OR gate
-NAND gate
-XOR gate
-Multiplexer gate
-NOT gate
-NOR gate
-Decoder gate
